# STL_C
STL_C is a custom implementation of commonly used data structures and algorithms in pure C language, inspired by the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++.
The goal is to bring reusable, generic, and efficient components (like vectors, lists, stacks, queues, maps, etc.) to C developers without reinventing the wheel every time.
